# collaboration-static-website
its a group assignment. 
let me give you a brief about it its a group of 2 members. 

we must create a webpage with below basic setup 
  1. Home page (index.html)
  2. About page (about.html) 
  3. contact page (contact.html)
  4. CSS style sheet (style.css)
    
     we need to select any one person github profile and create a repo (as of now we name it as "collabrative-static-website") and initiate with a readme.md and empty index.html (in our case liya is the owner)
     then we need to enable github pages on the repo settings rest of the team members should clone the repo to the local machine using git clone

     The project will follow the git flow branching strategy
       main: Stable prod code , represent the live website
       develop: Mani dev branch where all features are integrated before being merged into main
       feature: For each new feature or page we must create a new feature branch based off develop
